You have a fantastic, clean prototype. It's a great foundation. As a chief design expert, my job is to elevate it from "functional" to "incredible."

The current design is a "tool that uses AI." We want it to feel like "an AI you are partnering with."

My analysis is that the UI is "safe." The blue is corporate, the layout is standard, and the most important element—the text box—is the most "boring." We will change this with a "Futuristic Zen" approach: focusing the user, creating a "premium" feel, and making the AI elements feel intelligent.

Here are my step-by-step improvements.

Replit Prompt: The "Futuristic Zen" UI/UX Overhaul
Your Role: You are an expert frontend developer. Your task is to apply the following 6 "polish" tasks to our existing prototype to elevate its design from "standard" to "modern, elegant, and minimalistic."

Framework: Use React + Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for animations.

Task 1: Change the Layout to "Focus Mode"
The Problem: The left sidebar (with "Search cases...", "Swiss Refugee Family", etc.) is distracting. When a user is creating a new case, their only focus should be that task.

The Change:

Remove the entire left sidebar from this "New Case Intake" page.

Center the "New Case Intake" content block in the middle of the screen. It should be the single "hero" element, "floating" in space.

Task 2: Implement the "Premium Dark" Color Palette
The Problem: The white background and standard "UNHCR Blue" are flat and predictable.

The Change:

Background: Change the entire page background to a very dark, premium slate color (e.g., Tailwind slate-950).

Card Background: Change the main "New Case Intake" card to a slightly lighter dark color (e.g., slate-900).

Text: Change all primary text to a soft white (slate-100) and all secondary text (like "HOW IT WORKS") to a light gray (slate-400).

Task 3: Introduce a single "AI Accent Color"
The Problem: The blue is used everywhere and doesn't "pop."

The Change:

Introduce one vibrant, electric accent color to represent the "AI." This should be a vibrant cyan or electric blue (e.g., cyan-400 or blue-500).

This color will only be used for the main button, glowing effects, and active UI states. This makes it special.

Task 4: Redesign the Text Box to be the "Intelligent Void"
The Problem: The text box is a boring, bordered rectangle. This is the "magic" part of our app and it needs to feel like it.

The Change:

Remove Border: Delete the hard border and shadow from the textarea itself.

"Void" Look: Make the textarea background borderless and slightly darker than the card it's on (e.g., slate-800).

"Intelligent" Placeholder: The only thing inside the text box should be the placeholder text. Make this text subtly "pulse" with a CSS opacity animation.

Placeholder Text: Change it to: "Paste your unstructured case notes... The AI will understand."

Task 5: Redesign the Button to be the "AI Action"
The Problem: The button is flat, and the text "Analyze Case & Generate Case Number" is too long.

The Change:

Button Text: Shorten it to a powerful, single verb: "Analyze"

Button Color: Make this button use your new "AI Accent Color".

"AI Glow" Effect: Make the button "pop" by giving it a "glow" shadow using the same accent color (e.g., shadow-lg shadow-cyan-500/50).

Interactive Feedback: The button must be disabled (e.g., opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed) by default. When the user pastes any text into the text box, the button should immediately light up to full opacity and the "glow" should appear. This tells the user "The AI is ready."

Task 6: Polish Edges, Fonts, and Depth
The Problem: The app uses generic fonts and sharp edges.

The Change:

Font: Use a single, modern, clean font for everything, like "Inter" or "Manrope" (import from Google Fonts).

Edges: Make the edges on the main card and the button "softer" and more "elegant" (e.g., rounded-xl or rounded-2xl).

Depth (The "Glass" Effect): For a truly futuristic feel, make the main card semi-transparent and blurred. (e.g., bg-slate-900/70 and backdrop-blur-lg). This "frosted glass" look is minimal and very modern.
