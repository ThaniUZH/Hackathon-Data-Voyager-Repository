## **The Challenge**

This project was created for the UNHCR Legal Assistance Challenge, aiming to support pro bono lawyers in providing faster, clearer, and more accurate legal advice to refugees.

Refugee lawyers currently face major obstacles:

- **Fragmented information:** Legal texts are spread across multiple institutions and documents.  
- **Language barriers:** Many key sources are not in the lawyerâ€™s working language.  
- **Manual research:** Lawyers must read and cross-check complex legal materials manually.  

These issues cause delays, inconsistencies, and sometimes inaccurate guidance, which can result in lost rights or violations for refugees.
